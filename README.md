# Optimizing Bus Route Efficiency via Real-Time Passenger Density Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes public transportation usage data to predict real-time passenger density on bus routes. The goal is to develop a system that can dynamically adjust bus service frequency based on predicted demand, leading to improved efficiency and passenger satisfaction.  The analysis involves processing historical passenger data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance.  The final output provides insights into passenger density patterns and demonstrates the potential for optimized route scheduling.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the data analysis, generate predictions, and output the results.  Make sure you have the necessary data files (specified within the project) in the same directory as `main.py`.


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including metrics evaluating the accuracy of the passenger density prediction model.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `.png` images) showing trends in passenger density over time and the spatial distribution of passenger demand across different bus routes. These visualizations are saved in the `output` directory.  The specific output files and their contents will vary depending on the input data and the model used.
